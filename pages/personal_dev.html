            <h3 align="center">Summary and Reflection of Chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h3>

            <p>Chapters 4-7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener is about a man, Michael, who visits his old friend, Charlie, for advise on life and personal development based on the lessons Charlie was taught by Mr. Davis.
                The lessons highlighted in these chapters are quite valuable. Personally I can apply these lessons in my pursuit of success and being an overall improved person. Hence I will definitely be applying them to my everyday life.
